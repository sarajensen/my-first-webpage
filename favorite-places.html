  <h1>My Favorite Places in the World</h1>
  <p>So far, I've traveled some.
    These are those places that've stuck with me.</p>
  <h2>Mount Hood</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Hood">Mount Hood</a>
    is a spectacular wilderness area in northern Oregon,
    and has atop it a bomb summit.

  <h2>Arches National Park</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.nps.gov/arch/">Arches National Park</a> feels like
    you're on Mars, or the equivalent, with oxygen though.
